            <h1>My Recent Work</h1>
            <p>I’ve worked on a plethora of products and projects. Some tactical. Some strategic. Though, all lean agile, measured and incremental. Here’s a bit of what I’ve been working on lately. </p>

              <h2>Co-created & User Centric Openpay Product Strategy</h2>
              <p>Not unlike many, Openpay was prone to reactive product development. Often this meant less measurable and short term focus. Through deep user research, design thinking and product engagement, I achieved longer term and user centric OKR product planning. This longer term thinking gave team disciplines more space (especially designers) to evolve their respective practice positively generating high quality outcomes.</p>

                <h2>Improving How Openpay Works Together</h2>
                <p>Openpay’s technology team was a one team software development model. There was no design or product centric processes or practices. Through C-level engagement, empowering change agents and advocates, I evolved the operating model to a more distributed, autonomous and product centric. As part of this, I defined what design meant and distributed Openpays first design team throughout that structure. Openpay is more design and product centric than it has ever been.</p>

              <h2>Making Openpay Onboarding Easier</h2>
              <p>Openpay is an app that lets people buy immediately and pay over time. Though onboarding was overwhelming, adding unnecessary friction and stopping users from getting started. Through a redesign using elements of gamification as well as a more focused flow and softer language, I was able to make it easier to onboard, increasing new customer success significantly.</p>

              <h2>A More Coherent Openpay Experience</h2>
              <p>Users told us our experience was hard to use and often inconsistent. This reduced trust and credibility of our brand and prevented users coming back with confidence. Through a global design audit, I consolidated design patterns across our digital products into a version 1 design system. As a result I delivered a new breed product suite that was easier to use, more accessible (WCAG AA) and unified the Openpay experience.</p>

              <h2>Scaling Redbubble Search Filtering</h2>
              <p>Redbubbles product filters differ vastly across its product suite. Users told us they wanted more control as they were on the hunt for “their thing”. Through iterative discovery and collaboration with our users, I was able to design a model that worked across all devices. The model was able to scale with product and filter growth as well as leverage data science to personalise filter relevance. </p>

              <p><strong>Big bang delivery is dead.</strong> Users want you to sense their needs and respond to them now. If you don't, they leave.
